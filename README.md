# Vehicle Speed Detection

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of vehicle speed detection using Python, NumPy, and OpenCV. The system tracks vehicles in a video feed and estimates their speed based on their displacement across frames.


## Features

1. Vehicle Detection and Tracking:The system uses OpenCV's background subtraction and contour detection techniques to identify moving vehicles within the video feed. It tracks these vehicles across frames for speed estimation.
 2. Speed Estimation:
Based on the displacement of vehicles between frames, the system calculates an approximate speed in pixels per second. This estimation assumes a constant frame rate and serves as a baseline for vehicle speed analysis.



## REQUIREMENT

- Python 3.x
- openCV
- Numpy
